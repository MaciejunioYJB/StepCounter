# StepCounter
### Overview
The Step Counter is built on STM32. It is used for counting steps.
### Description
While walking, the human body moves vertically in a specific way, slightly bouncing. We use an accelerometer to analyze the changes of it's posision in space. By studying the nature of those changes, we are able to specify particular steps out of it and cout them. The number of couted steps will be displayed on a digital screen.
### Tools
* STM32F4DISCOVERY microcontroller
* LIS3DSH accelerometer (built-in)
* 4-digit display
* Software: System WorkBench for STM32 based on Eclipse
